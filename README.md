# CHLScrapingTools
Python scripts developed to scrape various game data from league scorers' sheets into db tables.

I am working on a project aimed at determining various aging curves, with the granularity of age by month, for players from the OHL, QMJHL, and WHL. If it proves worthwhile I intend to extend the project to include other junior leagues around the world. Accumulating the data necessary for the project involves developing custom scraping tools, designed to be used on each league's official game scorer sheet. These tools are included in this repository.
